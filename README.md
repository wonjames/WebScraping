# WebScrapping
Summer project 2020
Recently I have gained interest in the Stock market. 
Financial freedom is one of my main goals in life, investments is the best way to achieve this.
Research is one of the hardest parts of finding stocks to invest in. I wanted to create a program to make this process easier, faster, and more intuitive.
I use Beautifulsoup4 to webscrap from Yahoo Finance. My plan is to gather data of the top 100 stocks in each sector and find the best value stocks, overvalued stocks, high growth stocks.
