# WebScrapping
Summer project 2020
Recently I have gained interest in the Stock market. 
I decided to make a program to store data of about individual stocks, that I can reference later.
I use Beautifulsoup4 to webscrap from Yahoo Finance. There are 11 sectors, I take the top 100 stocks from each sector based on Market cap size. I put the data of each stock into Google Sheets using gspread.
